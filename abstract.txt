Protocols for secure multiparty computation (MPC) enable a set of parties to compute a joint function of their private inputs while revealing nothing but the potential applications for MPC are huge: privacy-preserving auctions, private private machine learning, threshold cryptography, and more. Due to this, an intensive topic of research in academia ever since it was introduced in the for the two-party case (FOCS 1986), and by Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson case (STOC 1987). Recently, MPC has become efficient enough to be used and has made the transition from an object of theoretical study to a technology in industry. In this article, we will review what MPC is, what problems it solves, is being currently used. the examples and references brought in this review article are far from compre- due to the lack of space many highly relevant works are not cited.
